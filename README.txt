This repository contains the CADENCE implementation for an 8-bit absolute value detector with a worst case delay of approximately 797 ps (constraint of 800 ps) and an energy consumption of roughly 187 fJ. The design was the most energy efficient design of all designs submitted for EE 115C W2016 at UCLA, and has a layout proportion of 1.488. You must own a CADENCE license to open these files.
